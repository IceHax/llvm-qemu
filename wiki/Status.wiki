= Week 1,2 =
  * read lots of qemu src and LLVM API docs
  * compiled op.c to LLVM IR
  * wrote simple prototype which:
    * loads op.bc
    * resolves declarations in op.bc
    * creates a TB function
    * adds calls to micro ops
    * fills in parameters
    * inlines function calls
    * compiles the TB function to machine code with the JIT
  * started work on llvm-dyngen which at the moment:
    * handles micro ops with parameters

= Week 3 =
the goal of week 3 is to get llvm-dyngen working for all micro ops
