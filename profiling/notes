executing wget binary:
llvm-qemu with optimizations: ~40% spent in optimizations functions

nbench:
disabling tb chaining causes big performance drop

system emulation:
llvm-qemu without optimizations: ~70% spent in LLVM libs

conclusion:
-> hotspot approach for system emulation, wget
-> direct block chaining to reduce time in cpu_arm_exec
-> LLVM takes up way too much time, try to reduce this
-> fast pass needed for hotspot approach to kick in

code quality?
